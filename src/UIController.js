If no projects exist maybe generate an example project or explanation text that tells a user how to create a new project

    //generate projects that are saved (function), this would be in the main section, within the notes and checklist ul's create buttons to add notes and checklist items, and within those notes and checklist items create buttons to delete those items. These checklist items will also be able to have a cross through them or not depending on if they have been completed.

    //generate projects as a list item in the nav's ul, and give them buttons inside their list items that allows a user to delete the projects, of course prompt with a modal if they are sure they want to delete the project.

    //generate project when user creates it (same function as above just called at different time (listener on a button that exists in the nav element))

    //don't forget that functions that add or delete things will need to repaint the page to include/exclude added/deleted items
